HLS4ML – LHC Particle Classification using Deep Learning
This project implements deep-learning models to classify particle-collision events from the HLS4ML LHC dataset. 
The goal was to explore high-accuracy architectures while keeping them lightweight and hardware-deployable.
Project Overview:
Built multiple models including
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Autoencoder-based feature extractors.
Performed preprocessing, normalization, and dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional physics event data.
Benchmarked architectures for accuracy, latency, and generalization.
